> **The AMWC 2024 Abstracts** highlight advancements in aesthetic medicine, regenerative therapies, and anti-aging research. Global trends in **full-face rejuvenation** emphasize achieving natural results using injectables, while **Bonsai Aesthetics from Japan** promotes facial harmony.  

**Red Light Therapy** shows promise in reducing herpes labialis severity, and **exosomes** are emerging for skin and genital restoration.  

Anti-aging research focuses on **molecular aging mechanisms**, with **collagen biostimulators** and **fat grafting for breast augmentation** gaining traction. **Glycans are being explored as biomarkers for aging**, and **mTOR modulation with Rapamycin** is being studied for longevity.  

Innovations in **laser and ultrasound technologies** improve skin tightening, while **microwave-based facial tightening** offers new non-invasive solutions.  

In **aesthetic gynecology**, **oxytocin gel** and **hyaluronic acid injections** show potential for treating vaginal atrophy, while a **novel PRP and botulinum toxin combination** is being tested for erectile dysfunction.  

Aesthetic medicine is also expanding for **gender-diverse patients**, offering personalized facial harmonization techniques.  

**Needleless injections using high-pressure hyaluronic acid** present a promising alternative for those with needle phobia.  

**NAD+ restoration is being explored to reverse biological aging**, and **Edelweiss extract** has demonstrated **anti-aging benefits by preventing fibroblast senescence**.

> ** The Ultrasound in Aesthetic Medicine** document discusses the importance of ultrasound technology in facial aesthetic procedures, particularly for **filler placement, complication management, and anatomical assessment**. It emphasizes that ultrasound can **help identify filler misplacement, prevent vascular complications, and optimize treatment planning**.  

Pre-treatment scanning is highlighted as a crucial step in **avoiding vascular structures** and ensuring accurate filler placement, reducing the risk of **vascular occlusion and malar edema**.  

The document showcases **ultrasound-guided dissolving techniques**, enabling precise **hyaluronidase injections** for filler removal, especially in cases of nodules or migration. It also explores the **depth and distribution of facial fat layers**, aiding in customized filler injections based on **patient-specific fat volume and anatomical variations**.  

Moreover, ultrasound assists in identifying **vascular structures such as arteries and veins**, minimizing complications like **vascular occlusion and bruising**. It further underscores **the role of ultrasound in managing vascular adverse events**, enabling the detection of **ischemic areas** and guiding targeted treatment with **hyaluronidase**.  

Additionally, the document highlights the use of ultrasound for **evaluating bio-stimulatory fillers**, which are non-dissolvable and require strategic placement.  

It concludes by advocating for **ultrasound training in aesthetic medicine**, helping practitioners refine injection techniques, improve patient safety, and enhance treatment outcomes.

> **The ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium 2025 abstracts** document highlights several key findings from recent studies and clinical trials on advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC).  

A **Phase 1 study on SHR-A2102**, a nectin-4 targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), demonstrated **promising anti-tumor activity**, particularly in patients who had failed prior ADC therapy, with an **overall response rate (ORR) of 38.4%** and manageable safety.  

The **CheckMate 274 trial** confirmed that **adjuvant nivolumab (NIVO) improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC)**, particularly in patients with **PD-L1 Ã¢â°Â¥ 1%**.  

The **NIAGARA trial** showed that **perioperative durvalumab (D) plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of metastases and death from bladder cancer**, with patients achieving **pathological complete response (pCR) showing better long-term outcomes**.  

The **FORAGER-1 study** on LY3866288, an FGFR3 inhibitor, indicated **robust clinical activity in FGFR3-altered solid tumors**, including those refractory to prior FGFR inhibitors.  

The **EV-302/KEYNOTE-A39 trial** demonstrated **superior progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (EV+P) compared to chemotherapy**, reinforcing it as a **first-line standard of care** for locally advanced/metastatic UC.  

The **ADAPT-BLADDER trial** found that **durvalumab combined with intravesical gemcitabine/docetaxel led to a high complete response rate (89%) in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)**.  

Additionally, **genomic studies revealed distinct biomarker profiles in young-onset and older UC patients**, which could influence personalized treatment strategies.  

Finally, **real-world analyses showed no significant racial disparities in survival outcomes for advanced UC patients** but suggested that **females had inferior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to males when treated with immunotherapy**.  

These findings support ongoing advancements in **targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and personalized treatment approaches** for urothelial carcinoma.
