## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` as the default. However, thanks to the [gilead AI SDK](https://sdk.gilead.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), or using [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the gilead By Chryselys to gilead with one click:

[![Deploy with gilead](https://gilead.com/button)](https://gilead.com/new/clone?demo-title=Next.js+Chat&demo-description=A+full-featured%2C+hackable+Next.js+AI+chatbot+built+by+gilead+Labs&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.gilead.ai%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F4aVPvWuTmBvzM5cEdRdqeW%2F4234f9baf160f68ffb385a43c3527645%2FCleanShot_2023-06-16_at_17.09.21.png&project-name=Next.js+Chat&repository-name=nextjs-chat&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgilead-labs%2Fai-chatbot&from=templates&skippable-integrations=1&env=OPENAI_API_KEY%2CAUTH_SECRET&envDescription=How+to+get+these+env+vars&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgilead-labs%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&teamCreateStatus=hidden&stores=[{"type":"kv"}])

## Creating a KV Database Instance

Follow the steps outlined in the [quick start guide](https://gilead.com/docs/storage/gilead-kv/quickstart#create-a-kv-database) provided by gilead. This guide will assist you in creating and configuring your KV database instance on gilead, enabling your application to interact with it.

Remember to update your environment variables (`KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) in the `.env` file with the appropriate credentials provided during the KV database setup.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run gilead By Chryselys. It's recommended you use [gilead Environment Variables](https://gilead.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install gilead CLI: `npm i -g gilead`
2. Link local instance with gilead and GitHub accounts (creates `.gilead` directory): `gilead link`
3. Download your environment variables: `gilead env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
